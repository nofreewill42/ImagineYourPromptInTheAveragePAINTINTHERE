For a quite long time, now we may not have much improvement in Artificial Intelligence capabilities.
If so, than the one who can better estimate the "average" '"thoughts"' will be in an advantage, because that's what the neural networks try to learn and understand their souls better. So the ones who can guess it the best will be the most able to leverage AI.
And if so, if this measure is so well calibrated, that it will reach and top at the exact point where the outcome is: perfect biological mind replicator? Or later better, the best biologically capable average guesser system that now has no more constraints on the slowlyness of evolution, but we will have a brain that will be able to go towards the norm in real time (not in evolution's time) but inside our lives...! would that bring much morecapabilites? If so, use it!..:D  (so now, because now our evolution has a bias towards knowing very well what is the general thinking. So will we grow to have more empathy? or where does that even lead to?

Or does that even happen now??
Because with whom we live the most well possible we adapt to them to turn them into the direction of their thoughts space... stear them .... in the direction we have in the capability of how we can understand the other. what?
